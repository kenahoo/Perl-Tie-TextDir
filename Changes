Revision history for Perl extension Tie::TextDir.

0.04

   - Now accepts the opening-mode as 'rw', 'ro', or a bitmask like
     O_CREAT|O_RDWR.  This improves compatibility with things like MLDBM
     and MLDBM::Sync. (Thanks to Joshua Chamas)
   
   - Uses File::Spec to construct file paths, so it should now work on
     other OSs like Windows, Mac
   
   - delete($hash{key}) will now return the deleted value, like it should.
   
   - General code cleanup - the old code style was rather embarassing

   - Lots of documentation updates

0.03  
   - No changes - just added a copyright notice, which should have been
     present before, but I overlooked it.

   - fixed bug in EXISTS method that reported that the keys
     '', '.', and '..' existed in a hash when that was not
     the case.
